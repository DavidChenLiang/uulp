       Display file or file system status.

       Mandatory  arguments  to  long  options are mandatory for short options
       too.

       --LL, ----ddeerreeffeerreennccee

       --ff, ----ffiillee--ssyysstteemm
              display file system status instead of file status

       --cc  ----ffoorrmmaatt=_F_O_R_M_A_T
              use the specified FORMAT instead of the default; output  a  new‐
              line after each use of FORMAT

       ----pprriinnttff=_F_O_R_M_A_T
              like  ----ffoorrmmaatt, but interpret backslash escapes, and do not out‐
              put a mandatory  trailing  newline.   If  you  want  a  newline,
              include \n in FORMAT

       --tt, ----tteerrssee
              print the information in terse form
